My motivation comes from the movie Inventing Anna, a perfect case study 
for the various forms of financial fraud, especially under the guise of
investments. The aim of this project is primarily to improve my skills 
in blockchain engineering, and the use of solidity.

My other goal is to build a product that reduces the chances of mismanagement
of funds significantly, by giving the investors the power to unanimously make
decisions and approvals on what the investee allocates the investment on.

By doing this, the investors are kept up to date on the transactions of the 
invested funds on a regular basis. This also ensures that the investee uses 
the investments for its intended purpose, and reduces the chances of the money
getting spent on a brand new Mercedes and a vacation to Fiji.
